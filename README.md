# FMCL

## First Minecraft Launcher

### About
A simple Java Edition minecraft launcher wriiten by Python(3.10).

My dream is to create a new minecraft launcher developing period for python developers.

### Platform support
Multi-platform support is nearly done!

If everything goes well, it will be able to run on any x86 cpu

### Making Minecraft launcher, you can do it too!
The FMCL core does not completely rely on the GUI module, so you can write your own GUI!

Because we chose the MIT open source license, you are nearly free to distribute the software however you want.

### How to build the program
##### For example, on Windows:
1. Install Python 3.6 or above on [https://www.python.org/](https://www.python.org/). **Please notice that you need to ADD PYTHON TO PATH**
2. Remember that if you continue, that means that some packages will be installed on your computer.
3. Make sure that all the packages are installed, then run **build.bat**.
4. Find main.exe, it is FMCL launcher executeable file, you can use it now.


#### Coding targets
1. Make stable launching core(Done)
2. Make stable downloading core
3. Make Forge/ Fabric/ Optifine/ Quilt auto-install
4. Microsoft account auth
5. Logging
6. Better UI(Download info, Launching info, Error info)
7. Resolve not responding problem
